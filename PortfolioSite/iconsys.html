        <p>At a glance view of all the rules that affect a user's global network.<br>2016</p>

                <h1>The Project</h1>
                <p>Network devices have many rules in them. Generally, these rules are paintakingly typed in via command line. They need to be deployed to every device on the network manually. If a rule that is shared on 1,000 devices needs to be changed, it needs to be changed 1,000 times. The goal with this project was to explore what a 'global' view of network rules would look like. How could we make it easy to make rules that affect traffic on the network. But more importantly, how could we allow the user to quickly see which rules affect which things and how well the rule is doing in terms of network performance.</p>
                <h2>Author's Note</h2>
                Normally, its really scary to share Balsamiq mockups because they don't look refined. But I love this project because it really highlights how visual hierarchy and white space are more important to an understandable design than really polished artwork. This icon system could be implemented in any design style and it would still work.

                <h3>Intent Based Policy Rules</h3>
                <a href="iconsysassets/is-contents-2k.png" class="boxer" rel="penpot"><img src="iconsysassets/is-contents-600.png" class="img-responsive-scale"></a>
                <p>These are a tiny number of slides from a large slide-deck I put together for "intent based policy rules." These kinds of rules are mentioned else-where here. But they are rules where the user specifies the intent of the configuration rather than specific rules. This page will show more of the visual system I designed for these rules, than the rules themselves. But I wanted to make sure we at least knew what we were looking at.</p>

                <h3>Visual Cues</h3>
                <a href="iconsysassets/is-visuals-2k.png" class="boxer" rel="penpot"><img src="iconsysassets/is-visuals-600.png" class="img-responsive-scale"></a>
                <p>This slide describes, in text, what the user is meant to see and how. Each rule has set icons for the various kinds of objects the rule can encompass. It also states that horizontal spacing is important. These icons should line up when rules are placed vertically on top of one another.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4">
                <h3>Single Rule</h3>
                <a href="iconsysassets/is-breakdown-2k.png" class="boxer" rel="penpot"><img src="iconsysassets/is-breakdown-600.png" class="img-responsive-scale"></a>
                <p>Three slides that go through every possible icon that can be on every rule and explain what they all represent. I think the coolest part of each rule is the success indicator on the bottom. Users tell us over and over that "right now" status is useless to them. They need to see the status of everything over time. The easiest example being: You get an email for an alert, you take 3 minutes to get to a computer a login and now everything is fine. "What just happened?"</p>

                <a href="iconsysassets/is-list-2k.png" class="boxer" rel="penpot"><img src="iconsysassets/is-list-600.png" class="img-responsive-scale"></a>
                <p>This is the rules table where all the rules get stacked together. This slides attempts to highlight the importance of the vertical alignment. Because the icons are always aligned, it is really easy to glance through the rules and see which rules affect which parts of your network and what sorts of actions the rule are performing on your network. Also, because of the "success" indictor, it is easy to see which rules are doing well and when.</p>

                <h3>Impact</h3>
                <a href="iconsysassets/is-impact-2k.png" class="boxer" rel="penpot"><img src="iconsysassets/is-impact-600.png" class="img-responsive-scale"></a>
                <p>Rules can affect Sites, Users, and Applications. However, not all rules affect all of those things and even if they do, they may affect 1 user or 10,000 users. Impact is a concept that attempts to quantify how many of each of these subjects are affected by a rule. Also, how does that change over time. This is incredibly useful for what our users call "change management." If a rule only affects 10 users its easy to change or delete. If a rule affects 10,000, more work needs to be done before changing it.</p>

                <h3>QoS Action</h3>
                <a href="iconsysassets/is-qos-2k.png" class="boxer" rel="penpot"><img src="iconsysassets/is-qos-600.png" class="img-responsive-scale"></a>
                <p>QoS is my <a href="qos.html">party trick</a>, because I've spent so much time on it. Each rule can have one of many actions applied to it. QoS is one of those actions. Above is a concept of how the user can pick the QoS class, and thus the performance of the traffic matched by the rule.</p>
