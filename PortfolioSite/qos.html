					<h2 class="left">Feature Knowledge - What is QoS and how does it work?</h2>
					<p class="left">QoS was an already existing, and popular, feature of the SteelHead. Its also a very complex feature. Because my coworker and I are not certified network engineers, we had to learn what QoS is and how it works. Luckily, Riverbed has an open door policy when it comes to employee access. My coworker and I spoke with many engineers that work on this feature. We learned which parts of it worked mostly automatically, which parts need to be configured manually. We also wanted to focus on why our users enable and configure this feature. There is a key piece of background to know before reading our findings. Enterprise networks are usually backed by private MPLS links, not internet connections. These MPLS connections are both expensive and bandwidth constrained. SteelHead optimization, in general, helps relieve this congestion. QoS assists normal optimization by allowing the user to prioritizing mission critical applications and de-prioritize non-business critical traffic.</p>
					<h4 class="left">Key Findings</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>QoS relies on sophisticated application detection. This is often referred to as 'Deep Packed Inspection (DPI).' Because SteelHead hardware is extremely powerful compared to normal router hardware, it has far more sophisticated DPI than most routers. This makes QoS far more powerful and capable.</li>
						<li>QoS operates not just on an application by application basis but also a site to site basis. This means that a user doesn't just say 'I want App Y to be treated like X.' Instead they say 'I want App Y to be treated like X when going to Site Z.' This, obviously, increases the complexity of configuration.</li>
						<li>QoS operates on both inbound and outbound traffic and CAN treat traffic differently in both directions. Again, this increases configuration complexity.</li>
						<li>QoS works by putting applications into 'buckets,' reffered to as classes. These classes then apply the prioritization of of the applications that fall into that bucket.</li>
						<li>QoS Classes at least specify a minimum bandwidth guarantee that applications in that class are allowed to use. However, the SteelHead QoS system is very sophisticated so, classes actually get to specify a maximum allowance, a minimum guarantee, and a latency priority.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Latency Priority: roughly specifies how quickly the packets make it through the internal packet processing systems in the SteelHead</li>
								<li>Minimum Bandwidth: guarantees that the applications in that class will get at least X% of the available bandwidth. The total of minimum bandwidth guarantees of all the classes added together cannot exceed 100% of the available link bandwidth</li>
								<li>Maximum Bandwidth: allows the user to specify a percentage of the bandwidth that the applcations in the class can never exceed.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Another Key Finding</li>
