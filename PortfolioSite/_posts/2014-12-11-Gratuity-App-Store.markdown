Gratuity was accepted into the app store! Yay. This is always so exciting. It kind of makes iOS development special. While I would always vote to get rid of Apple as the gatekeeper to iOS, it definitely builds suspense as a developer. I find myself constantly asking things like "Did I choose all the right options in iTunes connect?" "Will it crash while they're testing?" "What if they just don't like it?" Luckily, its a pretty smooth process. It sits in "waiting for review" for 5 days or so. Then you'll get a notification that its "in review" and then 24 hours later its in the store.

Of course, once it hit the store, I found a bug that I couldn't test until it was in the store. When apps have a link to themselves in the store (usually for reviews), you can't test it until its in the store. And of course, I got the link slightly wrong. So that was annoying. I had to build a new build, submit it to the store and explain the situation. Luckily, it appears their algorithm bumps quick resubmissions to the front. It went into review a day after re-submission and was updated in the store 48 hours later. I know this is faster than normal because right after I submitted that, I submitted a bug fix update for my other app and its still waiting for review. Days after Gratuity was already updated in the store.

**[So make sure to download it and give it a 5 star review!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gratuity-simple-tip-calculator/id933679671?mt=8)**
