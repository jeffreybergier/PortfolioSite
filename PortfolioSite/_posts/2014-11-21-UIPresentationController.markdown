Switched to UIPresentationController. Its new in iOS8 but it seems pretty powerful. The way I used it, I didn't do anything new over what was possible in iOS7. But hopefully we'll see more to come out of this class in the future. Check out the custom animation. There are [portrait](http://www.jeffburg.com/skitch/gratuityportraitanimation.mov) and [landscape](http://www.jeffburg.com/skitch/gratuitylandscapeanimation.mov) videos if you are interested.
